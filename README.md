# Fake Twitter - Frontend

This is the frontend of a **Fake Twitter** project, a simulated application that replicates the basic interface and functionality of a social network like Twitter. The project was developed using **Angular 18**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **DaisyUI** to ensure a modern, responsive, and visually appealing user experience.

The application includes typical social media features, such as a feed of posts, interactions with tweets, and an intuitive user interface. The main goal is to provide a simulation of how interactions with Twitter would look, without the need for a real backend, making it ideal for prototyping or demonstrations.

### Technologies Used

- **Angular 18**: A framework for building scalable and efficient SPAs (Single Page Applications).
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid, customizable styling.
- **DaisyUI**: A set of pre-built UI components based on Tailwind CSS, designed to speed up interface development.

This project serves as a foundation for creating simulated social media platforms or for learning how to build modern and responsive interfaces.
